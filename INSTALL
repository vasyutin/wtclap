Basic Installation
==================

WTCLAP is a header-only library, so on most modern systems you can
simply copy the .../include/wtclap directory to your project, or simply
add .../include to the include path for the compiler. The path prefix
"..." here refers to the root directory of WTCLAP (i.e., where you
cloned or extracted it).
