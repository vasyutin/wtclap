WTCLAP - Wide Templatized Command Line Argument Parser

This is a simple C++ library that facilitates parsing command line
arguments in a type independent manner.

Based on TCLAP 1.4 (Templatized Command Line Argument Parser, 
see https://sourceforge.net/projects/tclap/) but is made for unicode 
strings (std::wstring) widely used in Windows programming.

See ./docs/manual.html and ./examples/src for the details.

You can even use TCLAP and WTCLAP together in platform independent 
code. See ./examples/wtclap-and-tclap-together/src for the 
details.
