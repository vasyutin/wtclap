WTCLAP - Wide Templatized Command Line Argument Parser

This is a simple C++ library that facilitates parsing command line
arguments in a type independent manner. It doesn't conform exactly
to either the GNU or POSIX standards, although it is close. 

Based on TCLAP (Templatized Command Line Argument Parser, 
see https://sf.net/p/tclap/discussion/) but is made for unicode 
strings (std::wstring).
